			<h3 class="merit-color">The Project</h3>
			<span class="summary">Small internet service organizations need a low-cost, high-quality network security and monitoring solution so they can better understand and monitor their internet networks. My role: rapidly design and develop prototypes for this network monitoring software, known as AMON.</span>

			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Many small and medium-sized organizations cannot afford other commercial network analysis solutions, some of which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our solution, AMON, is a low-cost, high-quality network monitoring application that allows for real-time visualization of traffic intensity and structure over a network interface, identification of heavy-hitters, and detection of high-impact events such as DDoS attacks. AMON targets these smaller organizations, providing them with a low-cost, high-quality alternative to other commercial products.</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>My role with AMON was to rapidly develop prototypes of new data visualization and database query applications. Simply put, if we wanted to try out a new feature for the AMON User Dashboard, I would create it using Python and its Bokeh and Pandas libraries. These functional prototypes provide our team of engineers, statisticians, and data scientists with a simple dashboard interface to analyze, visualize, and uncover issues with our algorithms and data collection methods.</p>

			<h3 class="merit-color">The Process</h3>
			<span class="summary">As an Internet Service Provider, Merit Network allows me to build and test applications that examine, explain, and visualize live internet traffic flowing to or from IP addresses that fall under Merit’s internet service.</span>

			<h4>Access to Live Internet Traffic</h4>
			<p class="last-p">My work relies on the fact that Merit Network is an Internet Service Provider, which gives me access to live internet network traffic. Our AMON databases collect information on all of the network traffic flowing through Merit’s internet service. With this network information, I build applications to examine, explain, and visualize internet traffic flowing to or from IP addresses that fall under Merit’s internet service.</p>
			
			<h4>Visualizing Network Traffic</h4>
			<p class="last-p">The primary visualization that displays this traffic is known as the IP Pair. This displays all the network traffic in a single, real-time visualization that updates every three seconds to show current traffic. While this feature was already implemented in PHP on the AMON Dashboard when I joined the team, my first step was to recreate this visualization for my Python-based, "Bokeh Dashboard".</p>

			<h4>Developing New Features</h4>
			<p class="last-p">After this small application was complete, the next step was to start prototyping new visualizations of the network data. First, I developed an application that allows a user to look at past IP Pair visualizations using sliders to change the date and time of data that they are viewing.</p>

			<img src="static/merit/bokeh-app-03.png" alt="Historic IP Pair Bokeh Application">

			<p class="last-p">Next, I developed an application that visualizes the total traffic flowing over the network in real-time as well as multiple other simple applications to visualize similar network traffic data.</p>

			<h4>More Advanced Applications</h4>
			<p class="last-p">After implementing numerous other visualization applications, I began working on creating applications that allow for more a detailed look at the network data, such as listing alert information on possible internet attacks like DDoS attacks, or visualizations of subnets within the data to look at network traffic only entering or leaving from a certain sub-network such as the University of Michigan.</p>

			<h3 class="merit-color">The Product</h3>
			<span class="summary">To start building a functional dashboard that connects my applications and provides a cohesive user experience, I used a Python web development framework called Flask.</span>

			<h4>Connecting the Dots</h4>
			<p class="last-p">At this point, I had 10 functional applications built. The main issue that I now had to address was that while each application was working smoothly, it was not yet a “dashboard”. Each application had to be run on it’s own, and communication between each application was very limited due to the restrictions of building strictly with Python, Pandas, and Bokeh.  With this in mind, I decided to move forward and create my dashboard as a web application using a Python web development framework called Flask. Flask allows simple passing of data and user input between web pages, simple integration of the Bokeh applications that I have already built, and overall easier adoption for future developers that will work on this project.</p>

			<h4>Next Steps</h4>
			<p class="last-p">I currently have numerous applications built in this new Flask-based web dashboard. With proper documentation and numerous visual mockups to supply a concept of the end goal, the final step for me is to situate everything in a manner that allows for easy hand-off to the next wave of AMON developers.</p>

			<h3 class="merit-color">Reflection</h3>
			<h4>Asking Questions</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Throughout my education, I could almost always get by without admitting my confusion. I could read a textbook or wait for another student to ask the question that I had. At Merit, however, nobody was there to ask these questions for me, and randomly picking tutorials, articles, or documentation often felt like reading a foreign language. I quickly learned that I had to admit my confusion and ask questions, even about fundamental concepts of internet traffic, to ensure that I could move forward in the project.</p>

			<h4>Designing an Actual Dashboard vs Fictional Dashboards</h4>
			<p>Designing an actual dashboard takes much more thought and technical understanding than designing a fictional dashboard, like something you may see in a Daily UI challenge. With a fictional dashboard, I create data visualizations and interface elements that complement the visual design of the dashboard, and I can completely ignore technical constraints. This is not always the case with an actual dashboard. Data visualizations are not always clean and sleek, which can take a toll on visual design, but I have to work with the visualizations we produce because they provide valuable information to those that will use this product. Additionally, designing the AMON Dashboard forced me to account for technical constraints, especially as I was one of the developers actually creating the dashboard. I understood the how we were building the product, therefore I understood what could and could not feasibly be done.</p>
