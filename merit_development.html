		<h3>The Project</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p>
				Many smaller organizations cannot afford other commercial network analysis solutions, some of which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. With this in mind, our product targets these smaller organizations, providing them with a low-cost, high-quality alternative to other commercial products.
			</p>
			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>
				My role with AMON was to rapidly develop prototypes of new data visualization and database query applications. Simply put, if we wanted to try out a new feature for the AMON Dashboard, I would create it using Python and its Bokeh and Pandas libraries. With approximately 12 functional, prototyped applications, we decided to turn this “Bokeh Dashboard” into an onboarding dashboard that customers would use as a trial to test and learn how the AMON Dashboard works before purchasing the full software package.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>The Process</h3>

		<div>
			<p>
				My work pulls data from our AMON databases that collect information on all of our network traffic and visualizes this traffic based on the amount of traffic that is flowing over the network in terms of source and destination IP addresses.
			</p>

			<p>
				To better understand this, you can think of it like physical mail/post, such as letters and packages, entering and leaving the state of Michigan. In this case, my work would basically be to look at the sending and receiving address for each piece of mail and the volume of that mail. With this information, I am able to visualize in real-time where mail/post is being sent and received and how much mail is being moved between these addresses.
			</p>

			<h4>Examples</h4>
			<p>
				The visualization that started it all is known as the IP Pair. This displays all the network traffic in a single visualization that updates in real time every three seconds. While this feature was already implemented in PHP on the AMON Dashboard when I joined the team, my first step was to recreate this visualization with Python and Bokeh, the Python visualization library that I mentioned earlier.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next step was to start prototyping new visualizations of the network data. First, I developed an application that allows a user to look at past IP Pair visualization using sliders to change the date and time of data that they are viewing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, I developed an application that visualizes the total traffic flowing over the network in real-time.
			</p>

			<p>
				After implementing numerous other visualization applications, I began working on creating applications that allow for more a granular look at the data, such as listing alert information on possible internet attacks such as DDoS attacks, or visualizations of subnets within the data (to look at network traffic only entering or leaving from a certain sub-network such as the University of Michigan).
			</p>

		<h3>Next Steps</h3>

		<div>
			<p>
				In total, I have 10 prototyped, functional applications built. The main issue that another intern and I realized was that while my rapid prototyping was working well, the actual AMON dashboard was suffering from its construction using a PHP web development framework. With this in mind, we decided to replicate the AMON Dashboard using a Python web development framework called Flask. Flask is lightweight, allows for easier adoption when this project becomes available as an open-source project, and allows for incorporation of the Bokeh applications that I have built.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have the skeleton and a few features built using Flask, the next steps are to implement my Bokeh applications, style the AMON Dashboard, and situate everything in a manner that allows for easy hand-off to the next wave of developers that will be working on AMON.
