        <p>Some may prefer the term, “design generalist,” but I like baseball, so “utility player” it is. Being a utility player, I’ve been lucky enough to stumble upon many opportunities in many different disciplines.</p>

        <p>I have experience in design, development, and marketing for projects in urban informatics, cybersecurity, entertainment, solar car racing, film, and urban design.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I foster a separate slew of personal projects, from making music and short films to designing brands and developing web-apps. More recently, I’ve been learning Spanish, working my way back into printmaking, and writing a TV show, so if you know anyone with a printing press or network deal available, let me know.</p>

        <p>I’m looking to join a design team in 2020. Feel free to reach out to me about that as well at evanjpesch@gmail.com.</p>
      </div>  -->

      <div class="bio">
        <!-- <p>Most recently, I was a developer at Merit Network. Before that I was a wrapping up my time at the <span class="tooltip">University of Michigan<span class=popup-img onclick="showTooltip()"><img src="static/images/about/band.png"></span></span> with a UX project with Data Driven Detroit, leading marketing and brand design for the Michigan Marching band, and leading design for Michigan Solar Car Team. A few years further back, I was running a platform I co-created to teach people and start conversations about urban design in my hometown.</p>

        <p>All the while I’ve been making beats, filming short films, writing a TV Show, learning Spanish and ASL, and most importantly wearing my mask and staying at home because that is the civil and humane thing to do.</p>

        <p>Anyways, I’m looking to join a design team. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out and say hi at evanjpesch@gmail.com.</p> -->


        <!-- <h4>Who</h4>
        <p>I'm Evan Pesch.</p>

        <h4>What</h4>
        <p>My roles have bounced me around product design, brand design, web development, illustration, animation, writing, videography, sound design; the list goes on. I think of "design" as the most common denominator for the work I do.</p>

        <p>In my freetime, I've been making post-trap beats, writing a TV show, learning Spanish, and constantly trying to get back into printmaking.</p>

        <h4>When</h4>
        <p>I've been doing this stuff for the past 6 years, during which I was also getting a bachelors degree studying UX Design from the <span class="tooltip">University of Michigan<span class=popup-img onclick="showTooltip()"><img src="static/images/about/band.png"></span></span> and making thousands of <span class="tooltip">sandwiches in an industrial cooler<span class=popup-img onclick="showTooltip()"><img src="static/images/about/btg.png"></span></span> (had to pay for that degree somehow).</p>

        <h4>Why</h4>
        <p>I work to create things that make people happy, open, and safe. The scale of the term <span class="italic">people</span> can vary from the entire world to just one person. By <span class="italic">happy</span>, I mean bringing joy or improved mental health. By <span class="italic">open</span>, I mean accepting of people and cultures other than their own and receptive to non-harmful ideas and actions other than their own. By <span class="italic">safe</span>, I mean secure from the threat of danger, loss, and physical, emotional, or digital harm.</p>

        <h4>What's next</h4>
        <p>I'm looking to join a design team! If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out and say hi at evanjpesch@gmail.com.</p> -->

        <h4>The past 6 years</h4>
        <p>While my primary interest and education is in product design, my career so far has bounced around within product design, brand design, and web development with organizations like Merit Network, the Michigan Marching Band, and Data Driven Detroit.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this for the past 6 years, much of which overlapped with my time studying UX Design at the University of Michigan and making tens of thousands of sandwiches in an industrial cooler (had to pay for that degree somehow).</p>

        <h4>The past 6 Months</h4>
        <p>I've been living the dream in quarantine making post-trap beats in GarageBand, writing a TV show about bus drivers and deli workers, learning Spanish, drawing and designing whatever my heart desires, and building this website.</p>

        <p>As fun as this stuff is, it has provided the less-than-optimal financial support of $0.00; one of many reasons I am looking to join a design team! If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out and say hi at evanjpesch@gmail.com.</p>
