    		<p>D3 offers over 1,500 open-data resources about the Detroit area in a digital library known as their Toolbox. However, inadequate organization and display of these resources hinders peoples’ ability and desire to find useful data resources, resulting in uninformed decision making towards projects that can negatively affect Detroit communities.</p>

    		<p>My team’s goal was to <span class="bold">redesign D3’s Toolbox</span> to introduce an organizational system for data resources that is <span class="bold">simple</span>, helping people quickly and easily find resources useful to them, and <span class="bold">scalable</span>, remaining easy to use as the Toolbox grows with more resources.</p>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>The first month of this project entailed researching pain points within D3’s existing Toolbox. As it turned out, D3 actually had three separate versions of the Toolbox: their original Toolbox on their live website, a prototyped Toolbox which they had built prior to our involvement, and a Toolbox on an affiliated website known as the Open Data Portal.</p>

    			<h4>Defining our audience and testing</h4>
    	</div>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>Starting with heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis, we later shifted our research to focus on interviews and usability testing. With this, we defined our target audience as people from three general groups:</p>

    		<ol>
    			<li>People with data analysis experience</li>
    			<li>Detroit community members without data analysis experience</li>
    			<li>Urban Planners</li>
    		</ol>

    		<p>From here, we worked to test the three existing Toolbox designs with people from each of these three groups. Each tester used a single version of D3’s existing Toolboxes to complete tasks within that Toolbox. What we found is outlined below:</p>

    		<h4>Insufficient resource information</h4>
    	</div>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>While searching through the Toolbox, <span class="bold">5 of 5 usability testers felt each resource lacked enough descriptive information to know wether or not it would be useful to them</span>.</p>

    		<p>In addition to covering a variety of different subjects, D3’s data resources come in a variety of different mediums, cover different time spans, and correspond with different locations. Despite having access to this information, D3 only included a few of these informative details in each Toolbox, significantly hindering peoples’ ability to find useful resources while skimming through the list.</p>

    		<h4>Unintentionally Camouflaged Filters</h4>
    	</div>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>While D3’s existing Toolbox designs did include search boxes and/or filters, <span class="bold">3 of 5 usability testers did not use or notice available search and filter mechanisms in D3’s existing Toolboxes</span>, instead opting to read each resource’s title or description in order to find what they wanted.</p>

    		<p>With so many different data resources, search and filter mechanisms become necessary for people to quickly find resources useful to them. However, we found in D3’s original and prototyped Toolbox, these existing search and filter elements were unintentionally camouflaged on the page, often resembling menus or navigation, while Open Data Portal users were forced to filter by category, then given limited filters beyond that point.</p>

    		<p>There were more issues than just these two pain points, but for brevity, we’ll just focus on these two as they seemed to be the root of most problems with the existing Toolbox designs.</p>

    		<h4>Building a hierarchy of resource information</h4>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>As noted above, <span class="bold">a lack of descriptive information displayed about each resource slowed peoples’ attempts at finding useful resources</span>. Feedback from our earlier usability testers and discussion with D3 allowed us to specify 10 pieces of desired resource information that should be included for each resource:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Description</li>
          <li>Category</li>
          <li>Resource Type</li>
          <li>Thumbnail Image</li>

          <li>Metadata (location, filetype, file size)</li>
          <li>Project partners (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The challenge now was to design a skimmable way to convey all of this information in a small space for each resource in the Toolbox.</p>

    		<img src="static/light-grey.jpg" alt="Data Driven Detroit's three existing Toolbox designs">
    		<p>Caption</p>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>Early ideas took inspiration from job-posting websites by creating a new card-based layout for the resources listed within the Toolbox to give room for more resource information as well as consolidate each resource on the page into a clear, individual element.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>With these early iterations we found that horizontal cards offered good skimmability and ample space for the 10 pieces of desired resource information listed above. <span class="bold">For the content of each card, we developed a hierarchy of this desired resource information to guide peoples’ eyes from visual identification elements to broad text elements to detailed text elements</span>.</p>

    		<h4>Filtering similar to <span style="white-space:nowrap; font-weight:700;">e-commerce</span></h4>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>As we discovered, unintentionally camouflaged filters slowed attempts at finding useful resources. Early iterations to address this aimed to allow broad filtering by resource category by providing checkboxes for each resource category (kids & education, housing & neighborhood, demographics, etc.) on the left side of the screen and more narrow filters (resource-type, location, timeframe) at the top of the resource listing.</p>
      </div>

    		<img src="static/light-grey.jpg" alt="Data Driven Detroit's three existing Toolbox designs">
    		<p>Caption</p>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>These early iterations did not perform well in informal usability testing. Again, people did not use the filters, often noting that they mistook them for some type of navigation menu.</p>

    		<p>Our later iterations of filter mechanisms pulled inspiration from conventional online retail interfaces.</p>

    			<p>Caption</p>
    		</div>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>We decided to place our more granular filters (resource-type, location, timeframe) in a panel on the left side of the screen. With this, we reshaped our broad resource category tabs as large buttons and placed them above the resource list with multiple rows to make this a more obvious filtering step before browsing the full list of resources.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>Again, informal usability testing with low-fidelity prototypes confirmed that our filter layout generally offered more noticeable filters that better resembled what people were used to seeing from other websites.</p>

Specific tasks were given based on whether the testers were experienced with data analysis, inexperienced with data analysis, or experienced in urban planning. After discussion with D3, we decided to record completion time and perceived difficulty (based on a Likert scale from 1 - very easy to 5 - very difficult) as well as gather any qualitative feedback for each task.</p>

    		<p>While <span class="bold">our prototype had lower average completion times and lower average difficulty for each task</span>, 2 of the 8 testers noted that they preferred the visual design of D3's prototyped Toolbox over ours.

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>Amongst the many insights about client projects that I realized, this project illustrated one of the most important that I had not put much thought into before: even if I, as an outside designer, outline the business needs and technical constraints at the start of a project, I constantly learn what I can and can’t do as a designer as I go. Adapting to these business needs and technical constraints can make or break a project.</p>

    		<p>Had we not outlined the business needs and technical constraints in the beginning, our project would have most likely followed a constant cycle of pursuing a solution, learning that solution is not feasible or beneficial to the business, and redesigning the solution.</p>

    		<p>Even outlining these factors from the start did not save us from running into this issue a few times along the way. “Accept and Adapt” became the mentality of our team throughout this project and has shaped how I think as a designer nowadays.</p>
