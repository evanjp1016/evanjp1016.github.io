    	<div class="paragraph">
        <p>While using the Toolboxes, <span class="bold">5 of 5 usability testers felt that they didn’t know enough about each available resource to know whether or not it would be useful to them</span>. This was due to a lack of descriptive information about each resource.</p>

    		<p>Descriptive information for a resource includes basic information like a title and a short description as well as more granular information like what type of resource it is (map, dataset, presentation, etc.), when it’s data was collected, and what locations it addresses. Despite having this information for most resources, D3 only included a portion of it in each Toolbox.</p>

    		<h4>Unintentionally camouflaged filters</h4>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>While D3’s existing Toolbox designs did include search boxes and/or filters, <span class="bold">3 of 5 usability testers did not use or notice available search and filter elements</span>. Instead, these testers read each resource’s title or description in order to determine what resources would be useful to them.</p>

    		<p>We found that in D3’s original and prototyped Toolbox these existing search and filter elements were unintentionally camouflaged on the webpage, often resembling menus or navigation, while the Open Data Portal forced people to filter by category, then gave limited filters beyond that point.</p>

    		<h4>Building a hierarchy of descriptive information</h4>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>As noted above, a lack of descriptive information for each resource slowed peoples’ ability to find useful resources. Based on feedback from usability testers and discussion with D3, we specified 10 pieces of desired descriptive information that should be displayed for each resource:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Title</li>
          <li>Description</li>
          <li>Category</li>
          <li>Resource Type</li>
          <li>Thumbnail Image</li>
          <li>Date/timeframe</li>
          <li>Popularity Badge (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Download button (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Metadata (location, filetype, file size)</li>
          <li>Project partners (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To design a skimmable way to convey all of this information in a small space, early ideas took inspiration from job-posting websites by creating a card-based layout for the Toolboxes’ resources.</p>

    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>We found that a list of horizontal, rectangular cards made for easy skimming and ample space for our 10 pieces of descriptive information without requiring too much real estate on the webpage. For the content of each card, we developed a hierarchy of this descriptive information to guide peoples’ eyes from visual identification elements to broad text elements to detailed text elements.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">

    		<h4>Filtering similar to <span style="white-space:nowrap; font-weight:700;">e-commerce</span></h4>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>As we discovered, unintentionally camouflaged filters slowed peoples’ ability to find useful resources. Early iterations to address this aimed to allow broad filtering via checkboxes for each resource-category on the left side of the screen (kids & education, housing & neighborhood, demographics, etc.), while more granular filters (resource-type, location, timeframe) lived at the top of the resource listing.</p>

    		<img src="static/images/data-driven-detroit/solutions-06.png" alt="Data Driven Detroit's three existing Toolbox designs">
    		<p>Caption</p>
    	</div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>These early iterations did not perform well in informal usability testing. Again, people did not use the filters, often noting that they mistook them for some type of navigation menu. To remedy this, later iterations of filter elements pulled inspiration from conventional online retail interfaces.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>We placed more granular filters (resource-type, location, timeframe) in a panel on the left side of the screen and reshaped our broad resource-category checkboxes as large buttons, placing them above the resource list with multiple rows to make this a more obvious filtering step before browsing the full list of resources.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
    		<p>A second round of informal usability testing with low-fidelity prototypes confirmed that our updated filter layout offered more noticeable filters that better resembled what people were used to seeing from other websites.</p>

    		<h4>What I would have done differently</h4>
    	</div>

    	<div class="paragraph">
    		<p>The weakest point of this project was our usability testing. We formally tested numerous designs with only 5 people in our early research, between 5 and 10 more people informally throughout the design phase, and 8 new people during our final evaluation of our design. While all of these numbers are fairly low, the big issue was in the potential for bias in these tests.</p>

    		<p>While we tested with people that roughly fell into our target audience, the people we tested were chosen out of convenience. They were all either students or faculty at our university, or friends and family. They may have offered decent insight into pain points with the interface we were testing, but they did not accurately represent the people that would end up using this toolbox in the end. This “convenience testing” may have just as well introduced bias as a result of age, technological experience, accessibility needs, and familiarity with the Detroit area.</p>

    		<p>While we had discussed traveling to Detroit (only ~40 miles away) to test with actual people from the area that fell into our target audience, time constraints and a lack of preparation obstructed this goal. Looking back, this is something we should have allocated much more effort into achieving in order to be sure that our testing was revealing issues that our true audience would identify.</p>
