					<div class="section-body">
						<p>The visualization - built before I joined the AMON team - that acted as our base for this portion of the project is known as the IP Pair.</p>

						<p>The IP Pair is a heat-map which updates every three seconds, visualizing internet traffic volume between source and destination <span class="tooltip">IP addresses<span class="tooltiptext" onclick="showTooltip()">A “numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication”</br>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank">Thanks, Wikipedia</a>)</span></span> over a network. The x-axis displays source <span class="tooltip">bins<span class="tooltiptext" onclick="showTooltip()">Sorted and hashed collections of IP addresses</span></span> and the y-axis displays destination bins, while red, yellow, and green tiles correspond to high, medium, and low traffic between these source-destination pairs.</p>

						<p>Like mentioned in the “Problem” section above, many network monitoring tools cannot show this live data. With the IP Pair, we are able to not only show live data, but also visually identify potential malicious activity. </p>

						<h4>Ideating other features and prototyping (where I come in)</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="section-body">
						<p>Our goal was to create a dashboard where network operators could fully monitor and understand what was happening in their network, but at the time I joined the AMON team, we lacked other insightful features and visualizations beyond the IP Pair.</p>

						<p>This is where my early role was defined.</p>

						<div class="large-img">
							<img src="static/images/merit/images/ideate-prototype.png" alt="Data Driven Detroit's three existing Toolbox designs">
							<p>Caption</p>
						</div>

						<p>The first few months of my time at Merit were spent ideating new features with the rest of the AMON team then prototyping these new features, often taking the shape of interactive data visualizations, data tables, or iterations and adaptations of old features like the IP Pair.</p>

							<p>Product of an ideation session with the AMON team</p>
						</div> -->

						<p>The next issue was that for prototypes to be useful to us, I needed to prototype features and data visualizations populated with real, live data.</p>

				<div class="chapter-section">
					<div class="section-title">
						<h4>Coding live prototypes</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="section-body">
						<p>This desire for live data eliminated the possibility of using standard design prototyping tools like InVision or Adobe XD. Instead, I decided to code functional prototypes with Python.</p>

						<p>After a bit of experimentation, I found that coding functional prototypes with Python and two accompanying Python libraries, Pandas and Bokeh, worked well to quickly write small programs to retrieve and plot/display our data. Only being used for testing purposes, the ability to write quick, messy code allowed me to develop functional, interactive prototypes populated with real, live data in only a few hours.</p>

						<h4>Early dashboard prototypes and mockups</h4>

					<div class="section-body">
						<p>While the goal of these prototypes was to help our team learn about how our features would work in a production setting, we realized that their programmatic construction paved the way for us to quickly build early versions of AMON’s dashboard.</p>

						<p>As I began to design and prototype how each individual feature would interact with each other, I also created more high-fidelity, conceptual mockups of AMON’s dashboard to help guide us in thinking about user experience and accessibility as we moved forward.</p>

					<h4>Developing the alpha phase</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>AMON’s alpha phase was built more as a lightweight, prototypical version of our software rather than a full representation of the final product, meant for testing and feedback purposes. While it allowed for real interaction with network data, it lacked scalable structure as well as ideal security precautions.</p>

					<p>To develop this alpha phase, I cleaned and modified the prototypes I had been building to create a simple but more wholistic web application that better resembled how a final dashboard would look and work. From there, I wrote documentation on how to get this dashboard running with other networks and basic instructions on how to use the dashboard.</p>

					<p>The first public version of AMON was made available to selected clients and open-source developers in the summer of 2018. After it’s releases, we began work on AMON’s beta phase, rebuilding the dashboard with a more scalable structure and a focus on necessary security features, as well as taking note of feedback received from clients, in-house network engineers, and conference presentations.</p>

					<p>This version of AMON is available <a href="https://github.com/Merit-Research/AMON" target="_blank">here on Github.</a></p>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>With this next version of software, AMON’s dashboard needed to take a on a more robust form. Starting from scratch and building out a full <span class="tooltip">Flask<span class="tooltiptext" onclick="showTooltip()">Lightweight WSGI web application framework</span></span>-based web application allowed us to follow a more conventional Model-View-Controller structure while also focusing on security and privacy necessities</p>

					<p>While other team members tackled the security features of our new dashboard, I primarily worked to develop official versions of the features and data visualization I had been prototyping earlier.</p>

					<h4>Building dynamic data visualizations with d3.js</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>While the old prototypes of our features used Python and Bokeh, we decided to switch to d3.js, a JavaScript library, to give us more freedom in building dynamic data visualizations. This allowed us to not only design what types of charts and graphs we would make, but also how they would look and change with user input or real-time updates. These updated visualizations focused on performance efficiency as well as accessibility and viewport responsiveness.</p>

					<h4>Data retrieval and open source development with a RESTful API</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>To populate our features and visualizations with live network data, we decided to build a RESTful API to retrieve data from our back-end databases. This eliminated the need for our data visualizations to connect directly to back-end databases and rather allowed them to retrieve data from simple web URL’s with custom parameters.</p>

					<p>This both made my work creating interactive features and visualizations easier, as well as opened the door to open-source development of new features. With the AMON API, anybody with a valid AMON account could retrieve network data and build their own features or data visualizations.</p>

					<h4>Leaving the project before completion</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>Most of AMON’s contributors were either university-funded research students, interns, or part-time workers; all of which, including myself, would most-likely not be working on the project for more than a year or two. Knowing this, we wanted to be sure that new contributors would be able to easily pick up where we left off.</p>

					<p>I left Merit in April 2019. While we did not have the beta version of AMON complete, we had made it a point throughout the entire process to ensure that clear, abundant documentation and clean, understandable code were at the foundation of how this project would continue as team members changed.</p>

					<h4>Adapting to Business Needs and Technical Constraints</h4>
				</div>

				<div class="section-body">
					<p>Amongst the many insights about client projects that I realized, this project illustrated one of the most important that I had not put much thought into before: even if I, as an outside designer, outline the business needs and technical constraints at the start of a project, I constantly learn what I can and can’t do as a designer as I go. Adapting to these business needs and technical constraints can make or break a project.</p>

					<p>Had we not outlined the business needs and technical constraints in the beginning, our project would have most likely followed a constant cycle of pursuing a solution, learning that solution is not feasible or beneficial to the business, and redesigning the solution.</p>

					<p>Even outlining these factors from the start did not save us from running into this issue a few times along the way. “Accept and Adapt” became the mentality of our team throughout this project and has shaped how I think as a designer nowadays.</p>
