			<h3 class="lifework-color">The Project</h3>
			<span class="summary">College students and young professionals need something that keeps track of their work and social lives and organizes their time efficiently so they can live a more balanced, productive, stress-free life.</span>

			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p>While the initial intent was to design an app that manages time spent solely on work that must be done, reflection on the idea helped me narrow down to the core purpose of the app: to balance your time between work, life, and leisure. Lifework is meant to reduce the stress associated with poor time management.</p>

			<p class="last-p">Lifework syncs with learning management platforms like Blackboard and Canvas, project management applications like Trello and Jira, and general systems such as Slack and Facebook to construct a schedule that makes efficient use of the user’s time. The primary benefit of Lifework is that is builds free time directly into the user’s schedule to help the user relax and recharge between stages of productivity.</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>Being a individual project, my role covers every step of the design approach, from ideation and research to design and testing.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="lifework-color">The Process: Research</h3>
			<span class="summary">Interviews with college students and young professionals helped me identify the key pain points of their time management efforts and determine my primary user group.</span>

			<h4>Interviews to Identify Key Pain Points</h4>
			<p class="last-p">To start designing this application, I needed to look into the problems that people face in terms of time management. By informally interviewing 3 college students and 2 young professionals, I was able to get a better understanding of how these people attempt to manage their time and what the major pain points are in doing so. It is important to note that the convenience sampling used for interviews may result in bias due to the similarity of interviewees.</p>

			<h4>Key Findings</h4>
			<ul class="last-p">
				<li><b>College students</b> often want time for social activities during the night, but feel they must prioritize classwork</li>
				<li><b>College students</b> often need to balance classes and classwork with part-time jobs</li>
				<li><b>Young professionals</b> often have trouble balancing their jobs and personal work/projects</li>
				<li><b>Young professionals</b> often do not make meaningful use of their free time outside of their jobs due to a lack of motivation for productivity</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Persona</h4>
			<p class="last-p">After these interviews, I created a personas to represent my primary user group of college students. This would act as a guide for my thinking and design decisions throughout the next steps of my design approach.</p>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="lifework-color">The Process: Design</h3>
			<span class="summary">To effectively design a solution to reduce stress related to time management, I had to prioritize free time and social time just as much as class, classwork, and work as well as create a system for visualizing how time is used that avoided the daunting look of an average calendar layout.</span>

			<h4>Wireframing</h4>
			<p class="last-p">With the key findings and persona in mind, I began wireframing ideas of the general functionality of the application. I identified four main pages of the application: daily schedule, weekly schedule, event creation, and profile. These pages were essentially the minimum content and functionality that would allow the users to benefit from the app.</p>

			<img src="static/lifework/process-01.png" alt="Lifework Wireframes">

			<h4>Feedback on Wireframes</h4>
			<p>Based on feedback from my wireframes, I realized two main issues. The first was that free time and social time should be categorized as events on a schedule just as work or class were. This would help reinforce the idea that free time and social time were built into the schedule and just as important as school and work.</p>

			<p class="last-p">The second point of feedback was that the weekly schedule should be portrayed in a less daunting manner than the common calendar layout (similar to Google Calendar) as this can quickly become daunting as more events are added to a calendar.</p>

			<h4>Daily Schedule</h4>
			<p class="last-p">I began creating visual mockups of how information would be presented on event cards that would fill users’ daily schedules. I focused on creating a colorful and pleasant visual style with enough contrast and bold colors to quickly identify event-types (class, classwork, work, social, free time). In presenting information, I decided that salience based on color was an important factor in allowing quick identification of event type, but text displaying event type was also needed to clear any confusion and ensure accessibility.</p>

			<img src="static/lifework/process-03.png" alt="Daily Schedule Design">

			<h4>Visualizing Weekly Time</h4>
			<p class="last-p">While my design for the daily schedule page was a simple scrollable timeline, my design for the weekly schedule focused on a simple “mosaic” plot of how time is being used each day. Within the visualization itself, no information is given further than the event-types  and the times they occupy. This reduces cognitive overload by avoiding excessive information and allows the user to focus on how they are spending their time each day rather than what exact things they have planned. The user can tap an event to see more details, but this mosaic visualization focuses on time management rather than specific tasks.</p>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="lifework-color">The Product</h3>
			<span class="summary">As a concept product, I created a simple prototype of Lifework as well as experimented with motion design to give a closer look at how people would interact with the interface of the application.</span>

			<h4>Hi-Fi Mock Ups</h4>
			<p class="last-p">As a concept product, I could focus on creating a pleasant user experience for Lifework rather than building around the technical constraints that would come along with creating an application that syncs with so many other systems. I took this opportunity to create high fidelity mockups in both Adobe Illustrator as well as InVision Studio.</p>

			<img src="static/lifework/hi-fi-mockups-01.png" class="large-img" alt="High Fidelity Mockups">

			<h4>InVision Prototype</h4>
			<p>As a final product, I created a simple InVision prototype to layout the general functionality of Lifework. While this project was "completed" in June 2018, I often revisit Lifework, making subtle changes and practicing design thinking and problem solving.</p>

			<h3 class="lifework-color">Reflection</h3>
			<h4>Considering Technical Constraints in Concept Products</h4>
			<p class="last-p">With this project, I basically disregarded all technical constraints of the mobile application I was designing. While this allowed me to focus on other aspects such a visual design, this decision did alter a major part of the design approach: determining if this is actually the best way to solve the problem. Instead of designing a practical, feasible solution that solves the problem of stress due to time management, I designed a solution that would work in theory, but brings up many development and cyber security issues of creating an app that relies on syncing with a large amount of other applications. In the end, Lifework theoretically solved a problem, but also raised many questions that I did not necessarily have the answer for.</p>
