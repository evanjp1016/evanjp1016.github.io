			<h3>Work in Progress</h3>
			<p>
			This current portion of the project is to be completed between over the span from January to late April of 2018. Work will continually be added to this page as the project continues, so check back often to see what we have been working on.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Preface</h3>
			<p>
			Pardon my excitement, but I do want to say that this project is one of the most awesome projects I have worked on in my design career. The implications and impact of this project span much further than the usual niche market that my projects cater to. Our work will actually make a difference in how Detroit will transform into a “smart city” that makes use of data to drive informed decision making and planning. This project has the potential to shape how one of the fastest developing cities in America functions and grows throughout the coming years.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
			My team, made up of four students from the University of Michigan School of Information, is working collaboratively with Data Driven Detroit (D3), the Downtown Detroit Partnership, teams from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business and the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan, and numerous faculty members from U of M to plan and design solutions for a city-wide data coalition in Detroit. This coalition will revolutionize how open, accessible data is used to empower informed decision making in Detroit, helping Detroit become a “smart city.”
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Data Driven Detroit</h3>
			<p>
			As a subset of this project, my team is also working directly with Data Driven Detroit to redesign the D3 website - primarily the D3 Toolbox - to help users better understand the function and capabilities of the data and tools that are offered by D3. D3’s goal is to empower informed decision making in Detroit through the use of accurate, reliable, unbiased data. This redesign will help users make use the available data and tools to better inform the decisions they make while developing areas, services, and products that help rebuild and grow Detroit.
			</p>

			<p>
			Our team meets weekly with D3 to discuss our progress with the project and collaborate on advancing the project to the next steps.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
			<p>
			To begin research on the project, we ran three heuristic evaluations of the D3 sites, each following the guides laid out by Nielsen Norman Group’s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" class="in_text_link">“10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design”</a>. One on the current site that the public can view on the internet, one on the new prototype site that D3 has been developing, and one on a D3 affiliated site titled Open Data Portal.
			</p>

			<p>
			The primary issues for the current site revolved around the following:
			<ul>
				<li>4 issues regarding <i>help and documentation</i> with a severity level of 3 or higher on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being not severe, 5 being extremely severe)</li>
				<li>3 issues regarding <i>flexibility and efficiency</i> of Use with a severity level of 2 or higher</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			The primary issues for the Open Data Portal Site revolved around the following:
			<ul>
				<li>4 issues regard in <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity of 3 or higher (four of which have a severity of 4)</li>
				<li>2 issues regarding <i>match between system and the real world</i> with a severity of 4</li>
				<li>2 issues regarding <i>recognition rather than recall</i>, one with a severity of 3 and one with a severity of 5</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			The primary issues for the prototype site revolved around the following:
			<ul>
				<li>3 issues regarding <i>consistency and standards</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
				<li>4 issues regarding <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			It is important to note that these ratings are subjective and we use usability tests and interviews to validate the severity of each of the issue we discovered. 
			</p>

			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>While D3 looks at other organizations that do similar work to them as <i>allies</i> rather than competitors, we still wanted to get a better feel for what the field looks like in terms of digital product design.</p>
			<p>We identified two primary direct competitors that we would analyze, looking at general design choices around the navigation of their websites, the hero space on their sites, and the organization of assets on their sites (especially tools and data if available).</p>
			<p>Looking at similar points as the direct competitors, our analysis of indirect competitors included Netflix, Kaggle, and Amazon.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>User Testing and Interviews</h3>
			<p>The next step of our initial research phase was to start usability testing.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Detroit City-wide Data Coalition</h3>
			<p>We meet formally once a month with the teams from the School of Business and the School of Social Work to go over the progress each of our teams has made as well as plan the goals, requirements, and process for the next month of work. Between these meetings, we will be communicating with each other, organizing, and performing any collaborative work that is to be completed. </p>
