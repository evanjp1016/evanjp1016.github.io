		<div class="project_info">
			<p><span>Type:</span> Client Project for Data Driven Detroit: User Experience Design, User Experience Research</p>
			<p><span>Role:</span> User Experience Designer, User Experience Researcher, Visual Designer</p>
			<p><span>Team:</span> Four UX students, two outside student teams, Professional clients, and numerous U of M faculty members</p>
			<p><span>Date:</span> January 2018 - April 2018</p>
		</div>

		<h3>The Project</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>Ensuring that data is open and accessible to both professional organizations as well as the public is the first step toward building a smart city. Drawing inspiration from many European cities, as well as numerous cities within the US, such as Pittsburgh, <a href="drivendetroit.org" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Data Driven Detroit (D3)</a> is on a mission to grow Detroit, Michigan as a smart city. D3’s goal is to empower informed decision making in Detroit through the use of accurate, reliable, and unbiased data. The first step in doing this is to design a comprehensive, scalable library for all this open data to be stored and accessed. D3 calls this their Toolbox.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>My team, made up of four students from the University of Michigan School of Information, is working directly with D3 to redesign their Toolbox to help users better understand the function and capabilities of the data and resources that are offered. With a focus on comprehension and scalability, this redesign will help users make use of the available resources to better inform the decisions they make while developing areas, services, and products that help Detroit’s growth.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>Detroit Data Utility</h4>
			<p>In addition to our work with D3, my team worked collaboratively with teams from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan, and numerous faculty members from U of M to plan and design solutions for a city-wide data coalition in Detroit, currently titled, "Detroit Data Utility." This coalition will plan how open, accessible data is used to empower informed decision making in Detroit, helping Detroit become a smart city. Our work with D3 is used to guide our planning and design efforts with this initiative.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>The Process</h3>

		<div>
			<p>At the time of this project, D3 offered three versions of their website to research. These sites are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold-text">D3’s public site</span> - The publicly available site that housed general information about D3, the projects they have worked on, and the resources they offer to the public.</li>
				<li><span class="bold-text">D3’s prototype site</span> - An internal site (not open to the public) that acts as a prototype for a redesigned version of their public site.</li>
				<li><span class="bold-text">D3’s Open Data Portal</span> - A D3 affiliated site that allows users to browse and interact with approximately 1,500 data resources and projects that D3 offers.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Preliminary Research</h4>
			<p>Before we began ideating and designing new solutions for the Toolbox, we used research methodologies to identify key pain points and develop design requirements that would guide our future design process. Though competitive analysis, and heuristic evaluation (following the guides laid out by Nielsen Norman Group’s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">“10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design”</a>), we were able to better understand the most apparent pain points of D3’s toolbox and how other competitors, direct and indirect, approach these problems. Initial findings are displayed below:</p>

			<p>Competitive Analysis:</p>

			<table class="t02">
			  <tr>
			    <td>Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>About/About Us section and contact section included in navbar.</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
						<li>Filtering tool that allows users to filter by organization, groups, tags, formats, licenses, (no drop down menus)</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Shift Research Lab</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Netflix</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page based on mental model of a video rental store, where movies are categorized by genre</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Kaggle</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>

			<p>Heuristic Evaluation:</p>

			<table class="t02">
			  <tr>
			    <td>D3's Public Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>4 issues regarding <i>help and documentation</i> with a severity level of 3 or higher on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being not severe, 5 being extremely severe)</li>
						<li>3 issues regarding <i>flexibility and efficiency</i> of Use with a severity level of 2 or higher</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>D3's Open Data Portal Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>4 issues regard in <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity of 3 or higher (four of which have a severity of 4)</li>
						<li>2 issues regarding <i>match between system and the real world</i> with a severity of 4</li>
						<li>2 issues regarding <i>recognition rather than recall</i>, one with a severity of 3 and one with a severity of 5</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>D3's Prototype Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>3 issues regarding <i>consistency and standards</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
						<li>4 issues regarding <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>



			<p>It is important to note that these ratings are subjective and we use usability tests and interviews to validate the severity of each of the issue we discovered.</p>

			<p>In addition, later competitive analysis during the design phase allowed us to hone in on specific design problems and examine how other sites, solve with these design problems.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>User Testing</h4>
			<p>
			In order to validate the pain points we discovered in our preliminary research, we ran user tests on D3’s sites.
			</p>

			<p>Though D3’s data primarily focuses on the Metro Detroit area and therefore would be most relevant to Detroit residents, we decided to conduct our usability tests with Ann Arbor residents due to convenience for recruiting and scheduling. We realize this convenience sampling may introduce bias.
			</p>

			<p>
			Our team recruited participants for the three user groups, conducting five tests in total:
			</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Urban Planners</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A faculty member of the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">Individuals that regularly work with data</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying information analytics</li>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying statistics and psychology</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">Individuals interested in community information but with little/no data experience</span>
				<ul>
					<li>A sophomore at the University of Michigan studying communications</li>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying English</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>Personas</h4>
			<p>From our identified user groups and our research findings, we developed three personas that guided our design decisions as we moved forward.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Key Findings</h3>
		<div>
			<p><span class="bold-text">1. Poor Information Architecture and Categorization</span>
			</br><i>Many of the resources available are not categorized based on content, therefore resulting in a large unstructured list of assets. This resulted in users having to sift through many resources before finding the one that they wanted.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>5 of 5 user testers had trouble quickly finding information they were tasked with searching for</li>
				<li>Average task completion time was over 30 seconds, often due to time spent searching through numerous pages and sections of each site</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">2. Unseen Search and Filtering</span>
			</br><i>The search and filtering mechanisms were not obvious to the user. They did not see that they can filter for a particular resource, which meant that they spent a lot of time scanning the list instead of narrowing down the search results.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>3 of 5 user testers did not notice search and filtering mechanism in D3’s current site</li>
				<li>User testing validated this issue, which we had originally noted in our heuristic evaluation</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">4. Required and excessive hovering to see necessary information</span>
			</br><i>When conducting user testing we found that users had difficulty finding resources and understanding them on early versions of D3’s prototype. Users were required to hover over each resource to see reveal the title and description. This increased the amount of time it took for users to scan the page.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>5 of 5 user testers struggled with the need to hover over each resources in order to see information about the resources and find what they were searching for</li>
				<li>2 of 5 user testers searched through every tool on the "Toolbox" page in order to find the tool that they were looking for (in both cases this process took over 50 seconds)</li>
				<li>3 of 4 user testers commented and/or displayed concern with the numerous hover effects and animations</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">1. Poor Information Architecture and Categorization</span>
			</br><i>Many of the resources available are not categorized based on content, therefore resulting in a large unstructured list of assets. This resulted in users having to sift through many resources before finding the one that they wanted.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>5 of 5 user testers had trouble quickly finding information they were tasked with searching for.</li>
				<li>Average task completion time was over 30 seconds, often due to time spent searching through numerous pages and sections of each site.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

	<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
		<div>
			<h4 style="color: red;">Must Have</h4>
			<p><span class="bold-text">Better communicate what data is and why it is helpful in decision making</span>
			</br><i>Related Key finding: Ambiguous labeling</i>
			</br>Users with little data experience were overwhelmed and didn’t understand how to engage with data in order to aid their decisions.</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Better communicate what D3 is and how it is useful</span>
			</br><i>Related Key finding: Unclear mission and role</i>
			</br>Users didn’t understand D3’s role and how the resources could be particularly meaningful for them.</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Restructure listing of tools to be comprehensive and scalable</span>
			</br><i>Related Key finding: Unseen Search and Filtering</i>
			</br>Some users failed to notice key features on the site that would have greatly aided the completion of their task.</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Organize the site so important resources are salient for the user</span>
			</br><i>Related Key finding: Ambiguous labeling</i>
			</br>Users with little data experience were overwhelmed and didn’t understand how to engage with data in order to aid their decisions.</p>

			<h4 style="color: #e2b534;">Should Have</h4>
			<p><span class="bold-text">Remove data jargon to make the site understandable</span>
			</br><i>Related Key finding: Ambiguous labeling</i>
			</br>Users with little experience had difficulty clearly understanding what they were doing when sorting through information that they did not necessarily understand.</p>

			<h4 style="color: green;">Nice To Have</h4>
			<p><span class="bold-text">Improve the visual design of the site</span>
			</br>Users would benefit from a visually engaging and attractive website</p>
		</div>

		
	<h3>Design Phase</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Our design process for D3’s Toolbox was focused primarily on the personas and design requirements that were identified in the research phase. These requirements were therefore referred to often as we progressed through the design iterations.</p>

			<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
			<p>We began our design phase by listing and organizing ideas on how to address each of the four "Must Have" design requirements that we identified from our research.</p>
			<img src="static/brainstorming-01.png" alt="D3 Brainstorming">

		</br>

			<h4>Sketching</h4>
			<p>We began our low fidelity prototype development with simple sketches of the ideas we brainstormed. We shared these sketches with potential users and noted any feedback we received, often revising these sketches until we reach designs that sufficiently satisfied our requirements.</p>

			<p>Initial sketches laid out preliminary ideas for listing resources and displaying popularity for resources:</p>

			<img src="static/d3_sketches-02.png" alt="D3 sketches">

		</br>

			<h4>Wireframes</h4>
			<p>More detailed paper and digital wireframes allow for more detailed views of design components in the context of the full webpage. Using these wireframes, informal user testing allowed to make further design decisions to proceed with making a digital prototype.</p>
			<img src="static/d3_wireframes-01.png" class="thin" alt="D3 wireframes">
			<img src="static/d3_wireframes-02.png" class="thin" alt="D3 wireframes">

		</br>

			<h4>Low Fidelity Paper Prototype</h4>
			<p>From our digital wireframe, we created a paper prototype that allowed potential users to interact with our design for D3’s toolbox.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
			<p><span class="bold-text">First Iteration</span></p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Validation</span></p>
			<p>With our  digital prototype, we were able to run 8 formal user tests that to validate that users were indeed able to more efficiently and comprehensively use our prototype in comparison to D3’s other sites. We measured completion time for tasks and ease of tasks. We found that our prototype outperformed D3 sites in terms of completion time and ease of completion for all of the tasks we tested.</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">Second Iteration</span></p>
			<p>While our prototype did outperform D3’s sites in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative feedback led us to make adjustments to our final prototype.</p>

			<p>These changes included more salient correlation between the colored resource type labels and the resource type filter, white backgrounds for the category menu and the resource listing to distinguish these elements from the background, and a photograph at the top of the page to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the page.</p>
		</div>

	<h3>Final Recommendations</h3>

		<div>
			<p><span class="bold-text">1. Feature popular/useful resources at the top</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">2. Use colors to visually distinguish resources</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">3. Present important information in a scannable manner</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">4. Have category buttons filter results list</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">5. Show examples of possible filters on left</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">6. Avoid data jargon</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">7. Put the most important information at the top of the page (so a user can see it without scrolling)</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">8. Provide more guidance to users on the home page</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">9. Change the colors used in your Wordpress theme to match your brand colors</span></p>
