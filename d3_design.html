			<h3 class="d3-color">The Project</h3>
			<span class="summary">People need an easier way to access and understand open data for the city of Detroit to make data-informed decisions and play a larger role in the development of the city. My team’s role: design the library where this open data is stored and accessed, known as the Toolbox.</span>

			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Detroit, Michigan is in a stage of growth where decisions regarding the development of the city can have a vast impact on how the city functions in the future. Uninformed decisions regarding development, services, amenities, education and so on can adversely affect how the city moves forward. <a href="drivendetroit.org" target="_blank">Data Driven Detroit (D3)</a> is on a mission to foster Detroit as a smart city. D3’s goal is to empower informed decision making in Detroit through the use of accurate, reliable, and unbiased data. The first step in doing this is to design a comprehensive, scalable library for open data to be stored and accessed by the public and professional organizations. D3 calls this their Toolbox.</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p class="last-p">My team’s job: design this Toolbox.</br>
			My team’s job: design the Toolbox.</br>
			Made up of four UX students from the University of Michigan School of Information, my team worked directly with D3 to design their Toolbox. We focused on comprehension and scalability in order to help users better understand the function and capabilities of the data and resources that are offered.</p>

			<!-- <h4>Detroit Data Utility</h4>
			<p>In addition to our work with D3, my team worked collaboratively with teams from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan, and numerous faculty members from U of M to plan and design solutions for a city-wide data coalition in Detroit, currently titled "Detroit Data Utility." This coalition, made up of approximately 20 organizations around Detroit, works to plan how open data is accessed and used to promote informed decision making in Detroit. Our work with D3 is used to guide our planning and design efforts with this larger initiative.</p> -->

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="d3-color">The Process: Research</h3>
			<span class="summary">Starting with heuristic, competitive, and user research, we were able to identify key pain points of D3’s existing Toolbox designs to create 3 personas and develop 6 design requirements that would guide our design process.</span>

			<p class="last-p">This reflection will focus on the primary results of our research. See more detailed results of our research <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

			<h4>D3’s Three Toolboxes</h4>
			<p class="last-p">D3 offered three existing Toolboxes. One was on their public website, the second was on a D3 affiliated site known as D3’s Open Data Portal, and the third was a prototype in development that was shared privately with our team.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/three-sites-01.png" class="large-img">
			<!-- <div class="listed-info">
				<h5>D3’s public site</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>The main public site that housed general information about D3, the projects they have worked on, and the resources they offer to the public</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>D3’s prototype site</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A private prototype for a redesigned version of their public site</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>D3’s Open Data Portal</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A public site that allows users to browse and interact with approximately 1,500 data resources and projects that D3 offers</li>
				</ul>
			</div> -->

			<h4>Pain Point 1: Lack of Relevant Resource Information</h4>
			<p>D3’s existing designs for their toolbox provided enough relevant information for people to skim the listed resources, but did not provide simple access to more granular information so people could understand each resource further. In addition, resources were not always categorized in a useful manner, resulting in a large, unstructured list of assets.</p>

			<h5>Rationale</h5>
			<p class="last-p">Based on User testing:</br>
			- 5 of 5 user testers had trouble quickly finding information they were tasked with searching for.
			- Average task completion time was over 30 seconds, often due to time spent searching through resource listings without the ability to quickly find necessary information such as resource type (dataset, presentation, maps & infographics, etc.) or resource category (demographic, education, transportation, etc.).</p>

			<img src="static/d3/resource-listing-01.png">

			<!-- <h4>D3's Open Data Portal</h4> -->
			<img src="static/d3/resource-listing-03.png">

			<h4>Pain Points: Unseen and Unused Filtering</h4>
			<p>D3’s existing Toolbox designs either lacked filtering as a whole or provided filtering that was designed in a manner that went unnoticed by users. In turn, users spent more time reading through longs lists of resources rather than simply filtering to see resources relevant to their needs.</p>

			<h5>Rationale</h5>
			<p class="last-p">Based on User testing:</br>
			- 3 of 5 user testers did not notice search and filtering mechanism in D3’s current or prototype site.
			- User testing validated this issue, which we had originally noted in our heuristic evaluation.</p>

			<h4>Personas</h4>
			<p  class="last-p">From our identified user groups and our research findings, we developed three personas that guided our design decisions as we moved forward.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/d3-personas-01.png">

			<h4>Key Findings</h4>
			<p class="last-p">After completing our research phase, we compiled all of the information we gathered and listed our key findings.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/d3-key-findings-01.png">

			<h4>Design Requirements</h4>
			<p class="last-p">With our key findings in mind, we developed design requirements that would guide the rest of our project.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/d3-design-requirements-01.png">-->
		</div>
	
		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="d3-color">The Process: Design</h3>
			<span class="summary">We pursued an agile design process that gathered feedback on potential solutions through informal user testing and various weekly meetings with other UX designers and D3 team members.</span>

			<h4>Building a Hierarchy of Resource Information</h4>
			<p class="last-p">In order to solve the issue of D3’s designs lacking relevant resource information, we decided to design a resource list that made use of horizontal cards for each resource. For the content of each card, we developed a hierarchy of relevant resource information.</p>

			<!-- <img src="static/d3/brainstorming-01.png" class="small-img"> -->

			<h4>Apparent and Engaging Filtering: First Iteration</h4>
			<p class="last-p">To solve the issue of neglected filtering, we initially focused on allowing for simple filtering by resource category by providing navigational tabs for each category. With this, we place other filters at the top of the resource listing.</p>

			<h4>Apparent and Engaging Filtering: Second Iteration</h4>
			<p>However, feedback from user tests and meetings with other designers showed that our initial design did not actually solve the problem. Instead, people overlooked our filters above the resource list and mistook the category tabs as a some sort of secondary navigation, similar to the issues we found with the filtering on D3’s public site.</p>

			<p>Our second iteration aimed to pull inspiration from online retail interfaces and the D3 Open Data Portal. Placing the more complex filters, such as resource type and location, on the left side of the screen, similar to how many online retail interfaces are often designed, resulted more apparent filtering that less resembled some sort of navigation. With this, we decided to move the category tabs above the resource list and reshape those as large buttons, similar to the forced category filtering in D3’s Open Data Portal.</p>

			<p class="last-p">Based on informal user testing, this solution resulted in more use of the filtering mechanisms.</p>

			<!-- <img src="static/d3/sketches-02.png" class="small-img">
			<img src="static/d3/sketches-03.png" class="small-img">

			<h4>Wireframes</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Moving forward, we created more detailed paper and digital wireframes, allowing for more detailed views of design components in the context of the full webpage. Using these wireframes, informal user testing allowed us to ensure that the design ideas that we had been working with did indeed fulfill our design requirements.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/wireframes-all-01.png">

			<h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
			<p class="last-p">From our digital wireframe, we created a paper prototype that allowed potential users to interact with our design for D3’s toolbox. With informal user testing, we had people to interact with the site as if they were simply browsing the site and exploring the content. We noted qualitative feedback to get a better understanding of how people interacted with and felt about the design.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/paper-prototype.png" class="small-img">

			<h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
			<h5>First Iteration</h5>

			<img src="static/d3/first-iteration.png" class="small-img needs-border">

			<h5>Validation</h5>
			<p class="last-p">With our  digital prototype, we were able to run 8 formal user tests to validate that users were able to more efficiently and comprehensively use our prototype in comparison to D3’s other sites. We measured completion time for three tasks and difficulty of completing these tasks. The tasks were customized depending on which of our three user groups the tester aligned with. We found that our prototype outperformed D3 sites in both completion time and ease of completion for all of the tasks we tested.</p>

			<h5>Second Iteration</h5>
			<p class="last-p">While our prototype did outperform D3 sites in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative feedback led us to make adjustments to our final prototype.</p>

			<img src="static/d3/second-iteration.png" class="small-img needs-border">

			<h4>Final Recommendations</h4>
			<p class="last-p">While our work on this project demonstrated a full process of research and design, a large part of the deliverables of this project was to provide D3 with a list of UX recommendations supported by our research. Due to technical constraints developing the redesigned site, D3 would use these recommendations to implement our work with the development capabilities they have rather than directly replicating the final design we created.</p>

			<p><span class="bold-text">1. Feature popular/useful resources at the top</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">2. Use colors to visually distinguish resources</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">3. Present important information in a scannable manner</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">4. Have category buttons filter results list</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">5. Show examples of possible filters on left</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">6. Avoid data jargon</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">7. Put the most important information at the top of the page (so a user can see it without scrolling)</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">8. Provide more guidance to users on the home page</span></p>
			<p><span class="bold-text">9. Change the colors used in your Wordpress theme to match your brand colors</span></p> -->

			<h3 class="d3-color">The Product</h3>
			<span class="summary">With the solutions for the resource information hierarchy and filtering, our final step was to put this all together in a full Toolbox interface and test it in comparison to D3’s existing Toolbox designs.</span>

			<h4>First Iteration</h4>

			<img src="#">

			<p>Our first prototype tested well against D3’s existing sites in terms of average time to complete user testing tasks. </p>

			<img src="#">

			<p class="last-p">However, our design did not do very well in terms of qualitative feedback. 5 of the 8 people we tested noted that our design was easier to use, but less aesthetically pleasing. Multiple users noted that they would prefer to use D3’s existing sites over our prototype strictly due to the visual appeal.</p>

			<h4>Second Iteration and Prototype</h4>
			<p>Based on the feedback from our first prototype iteration, we created a second iteration that evolved the visual design of our Toolbox interface.</p>

			<h3 class="d3-color">Reflection</h3>

			<h4>Working With Clients</h4>
			<p>I’ve worked with clients before, but never as closely as I did with this project. With this, I realized that as much as the goal is to design for the needs of the people that will use this product, it is also just as important to think about the business side of the project. Technical constraints of development, deadlines, and existing user bases were just a few of the multiple business-side factors that guided our design approach.</p>

			<p class="last-p">On the other hand, it also became apparent that our clients needed guidance from us just as much as we did from them. While they are the experts on their business and in their field, the members of my team were the design experts. That balance had to be managed, and the communication and teamwork between my team and our clients was what kept this project running smoothly.</p>

			<h4>Research and Validation</h4>
			<p class="last-p">While research and validation were always preached throughout my design education, these are two things that often got overlooked on many of the real projects I’ve worked on. With this project, however, research and validation acted as guides throughout our entire design process, and I realized just how important these steps are in creating solutions that actually solve the problem at hand. Whether it was user testing, meetings with other designers, or even simple competitive analysis, research and validation acted as a rationale for each decision we made throughout the design process.</p>
