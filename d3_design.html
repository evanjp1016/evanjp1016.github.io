			<h2>Data Driven Detroit</h2>
			<p><i>Work in progress</i></p>
		</div>

		<div class="project_info">
			<p><span>Project Type:</span> User Experience Design, User Experience Research</p>
			<p><span>Date:</span> January 2018 - April 2018</p>
			<p><span>Role:</span> User Experience Designer, User Experience Researcher</p>
			<p><span>Work Setting:</span> Team of 4 collaborating with other student teams and multiple professional clients</p>
			<p><span>Goal:</span> Provide community members in and around Detroit with a simple means of accessing, understanding, and using open data to empower informed decision making</p>
		</div>

		<h3>The Project</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>
			My team, made up of four students from the University of Michigan School of Information, is working directly with Data Driven Detroit (D3) to redesign the <a href="drivendetroit.org" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">D3 website</a> - primarily the D3 Toolbox - to help users better understand the function and capabilities of the data and tools that are offered by D3. D3’s goal is to empower informed decision making in Detroit through the use of accurate, reliable, unbiased data. This redesign will help users make use of the available data and tools to better inform the decisions they make while developing areas, services, and products that help rebuild Detroit.
			</p>

		</br>

			<h4>Detroit Data Utility</h4>
			<p>In addition to our work with D3, my team is working collaboratively teams from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan, and numerous faculty members from U of M to plan and design solutions for a city-wide data coalition in Detroit, currently titled, "Detroit Data Utility." This coalition will plan how open, accessible data is used to empower informed decision making in Detroit, helping Detroit become a “smart city.” Our work with D3 is used to guide our planning and design efforts with this initiative.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Research Phase</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>While D3 looks at other organizations that do similar work to them as <i>allies</i> rather than competitors, we still wanted to get a better feel for what the field looks like in terms of digital product design.</p>
			<p>Two direct competitors, <a href="https://www.wprdc.org/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</a> and <a href="https://www.shiftresearchlab.org/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Shift Research Lab</a>, were analyzed looking at general design choices around the navigation of their websites, the hero space on their sites, and the organization of assets on their sites (especially tools and data if available). Similarly, our analysis of indirect competitors included <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Kaggle</a></p>

			<table class="t02">
			  <tr>
			    <td>Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>About/About Us section and contact section included in navbar.</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
						<li>Filtering tool that allows users to filter by organization, groups, tags, formats, licenses, (no drop down menus)</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Shift Research Lab</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Netflix</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page based on mental model of a video rental store, where movies are categorized by genre</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Kaggle</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Call-to-action button, further engaging users and directing them towards a successful digital journey</li>
						<li>Display multiple asset categories on the home page</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>



			<p>Later competitive analysis during the design phase is allowing us to hone in on specific design problems that we will are working with and look at how other sites, such as Amazon and Target, deal with these design problems.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
			<p>
			To begin research on the project, we ran three heuristic evaluations of the D3 sites, each following the guides laid out by Nielsen Norman Group’s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">“10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design”</a>.
			</p>

			<p>One on D3’s <a href="drivendetroit.org" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">current site</a> that the public can view online, one on D3’s new prototype site that is in development (we have agreed not to share this site aside from screenshots), and one on a D3’s <a href="http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/" class="in_text_link" target="_blank">Open Data Portal</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			It is important to note that these ratings are subjective and we use usability tests and interviews to validate the severity of each of the issue we discovered. 
			</p>

			<table class="t02">
			  <tr>
			    <td>Current Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>4 issues regarding <i>help and documentation</i> with a severity level of 3 or higher on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being not severe, 5 being extremely severe)</li>
						<li>3 issues regarding <i>flexibility and efficiency</i> of Use with a severity level of 2 or higher</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Open Data Portal Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>4 issues regard in <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity of 3 or higher (four of which have a severity of 4)</li>
						<li>2 issues regarding <i>match between system and the real world</i> with a severity of 4</li>
						<li>2 issues regarding <i>recognition rather than recall</i>, one with a severity of 3 and one with a severity of 5</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			    <td>Prototype Site</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>3 issues regarding <i>consistency and standards</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
						<li>4 issues regarding <i>aesthetic and minimalist design</i> with a severity rating of 3 or higher</li>
					</ul>
			    </td>
			  </tr>
			</table>

		</br>

			<h4>User Testing</h4>
			<p>Our heuristic evaluations revealed numerous issues with the current and prototype sites, but since our severity ratings were subjective, we needed to conduct usability tests to validate our claims.</p>

			<p>Though D3’s data primarily focuses on the Metro Detroit area and therefore would be most relevant to Detroit residents, we decided to conduct our usability tests with Ann Arbor residents due to convenience for recruiting and scheduling. This also allowed us to work out any unforeseen issues with our usability tests before visiting Detroit to talk with a more ideal user-base. We realize this convenience sampling may introduce bias.</p>

			<p>While traveling to Detroit is still in planning, the trip would be beneficial to assess how potential users within the community interact with D3’s site.</p>

			<p>Our team recruited participants for the three user groups, conducting five tests in total:</p>

			<p><h5>Urban Planners</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A faculty member of the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><h5>Individuals that regularly work with data</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying information analytics</li>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying statistics and psychology</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><h5>Individuals interested in community information but with little/no data experience</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A sophomore at the University of Michigan studying communications</li>
					<li>A senior at the University of Michigan studying English</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		</br>

			<h4>Card Sorting</h4>
			<p>After usability testing, we conducted open card sorting with individuals using the content from D3’s Navigation Bar on their prototype. This allowed us to better understand how potential users understand and expect the navigation to function.</p>

			<img src="static/cardsorting-01.png" alt="D3 Card Sorting">
			<p><h5>First participant created four categories:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>D3 Assets</li>
					<li>About</li>
					<li>User Interaction</li>
					<li>Miscellaneous</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><h5>Second participant created four categories:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Who We Are</li>
					<li>History</li>
					<li>Resources</li>
					<li>Outliers (Blog)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><h5>Third participant created five categories:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Core Product/Purpose</li>
					<li>“About” Info</li>
					<li>“Join” Info</li>
					<li>“Helpful” Info</li>
					<li>Outliers (Blog, Other Resources)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3>Key Findings</h3>

		<div>
			<h5>1. Unclear Mission and Role</h5>
			<p><i>When asked what they believe D3 does, many users just read the mission statement on the home page on both the current site and the prototype site. When prompted about what the mission statement meant, we received varied, vague responses.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>3 of 4 user testers had trouble accurately explaining D3's mission and role based on the provided information.</li>
				<li>Not originally noted in heuristic evaluations</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>2. Unseen Search and Filtering</h5>
			<p><i>On the current site’s Portfolio page, the search and filtering mechanism is not obvious. Many users were drawn to the colored containers for tools, projects, datasets, etc. and didn’t notice that it was possible to search for a particular resource. Therefore, when asked to find a particular resource, users spent a long time searching each container instead of simply searching for the tool.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>2 of 4 user testers did not notice search and filtering mechanism</li>
				<li>User testing validated this issue, which we had originally noted in heuristic evaluations</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h5>3. Ambiguous Title for Projects</h5>
			<p><i>Under the “Our Work” button in the navigation bar of the prototype is a page called “D3 Atlas.” The label is not a descriptive name and is misleading. It navigates to a page dedicated to showcasing projects, but when users were asked to find projects D3 had done in the past, two of the users failed to find the page.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>2 of 4 user testers commented or displayed trouble with the ambiguity of the title.</li>
				<li>Note: The title "D3 atlas was recently changed to "D3 Toolbox" on the D3 prototype site.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h5>4. Required Hover to See Necessary Information</h5>
			<p><i>The Prototype’s Toolbox page does not have any labels for the tools. Therefore all of the users have to hover over each tool/project in order to learn about it and potentially find the one they were looking for.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>4 of 4 user testers displayed the need to hover over multiple tool/project in order to see information about each asset and find whichever tool or project they were looking for.</li>
				<li>2 of 4 user testers searched through each tool on the "Toolbox" page in order to find the tool that they were looking for. In both cases this process took over 50 seconds.</li>
				<li>This issue was originally noted in the heuristic evaluations, though we feel as though we should increase the initial severity we assigned to the issue from 4 to 5.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h5>5. Excessive Hover Effects and Animations</h5>
			<p><i>On the prototype site, an overuse of hover effects and animations are used for interactions, complicating a user’s access to important information. The prevalence and intensity of the animations disorients the user and hinders their ability to find this information quickly.</i>
			<ul>
				<li>2 of 4 user testers commented and/or displayed concern with the numerous hover effects and animations.</li>
				<li>According to an Urban Planner that we tested with, “the flash is a little unnecessary.”</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<table id="t01">
			  <tr>
			    <td>Must Have</td>
			    <td>
			    	<ul>
						<li>Better communicate what data is and why it is helpful in decision making</li>
						<li>Better communicate what D3 is and how it is useful</li>
						<li>Restructure listing of tools to be comprehensive and scalable</li>
						<li>Organize the site so important resources are salient for the user</li>

			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Design Phase</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
			<p>We began our design phase by listing and organizing ideas on how to address each of the four "Must Have" design requirements that we identified based on our research.</p>
			<img src="static/brainstorming-01.png" alt="D3 Brainstorming">

		</br>

			<h4>Sketching</h4>
			<p>From our brainstorming, we chose a few ideas that we would proceed with. So far we have focused on categorization and structure of D3’s toolbox, where public resources and data is available to inform decision making in the Detroit area.</p>

			<p>We began our low fidelity prototype development with simple sketches of these ideas. We shared these sketches with potential users and noted any feedback we received, constantly revising these sketches until we reach designs that sufficiently satisfied our requirements.</p>

			<img src="static/d3_sketches-01.png" alt="D3 sketches">
			<img src="static/d3_sketches-02.png" alt="D3 sketches">

		</br>

			<h4>Wireframing</h4>
			<p>With these sketches and the feedback we received, we developed simple physical and digital wireframes to better display our design choices in context of D3’s website.</p>
			<img src="static/d3_wireframes-01.png" class="thin" alt="D3 wireframes">
			<img src="static/d3_wireframes-02.png" class="thin" alt="D3 wireframes">

		</br>

			<h4>Low Fidelity Paper Prototype</h4>
			<p>From our digital wireframe, we created a paper prototype that allowed potential users to interact with our design for D3’s toolbox. We have began user testing with this prototype and are currently in the process of analyzing feedback on the interface.</p>

		</div>

		<h3>Next Steps</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>Visit Detroit</h4>
			<p>We are currently coordinating a trip with our counterparts from the School of Business and the School of Social Work in the coming weeks to test prototypes of our designs and run interviews with stakeholders and current/potential users of the D3 site.</p>

			<p>With the findings we collect from Detroit, we plan to revise our personas and create user journeys in order to better assist our decision making in the design phase of this project.</p>

		</br>

			<h4>Design the Journey from the Homepage to the Toolbox</h4>
			<p>With our toolbox design testing underway, we plan to soon develop high fidelity prototypes of our redesigned interface.</p>
			<p>The next step from here is to connect the dots so that a user entering the site knows both how D3 and their open data can help them as well as how they can find and start using the data and tools to further their understanding of the city and communities of interest.</p>
