			<h3 class="mkg-color">The Project</h3>
			<span class="summary">Residents of Muskegon, Michigan need a convenient way to learn about urban development efforts in the area and a dependable way to provide community input towards these efforts so they can play a valid role in the growth of the city.</span>

			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Aside from personal research or sporadic local news, both of which rarely move beyond surface level analysis, Muskegon residents lack a source of education on urban planning and design efforts in the area. Our solution, Reimagine Muskegon, was a social media-based project promoting community, diversity, and city strength through education and contextualization of urban design in Muskegon.</p>

			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Our role with this project was to educate the general public on the development, form, and function of urban areas in Muskegon, and promote community discussion about these topics. In terms of our educational role, we focused on historic and present day context, social impact, and future growth of these urban areas. In addition to these educational efforts, we also focus on promoting discussion amongst our followers, frequently asking open questions and gauging opinions on topics.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="mkg-color">The Process</h3>
			<span class="summary">Social media offered a medium that would reach a large audience, and anonymity allowed us to hide any factors that may hinder the perceived validity of our work.</span>

			<h4>Choosing a Medium</h4>
			<p class="last-p">With this broad concept of “promoting community, diversity, and city strength through education and contextualization of urban design” we had plenty of options as to how we would actually formulate this project. We discussed physical efforts, such as pamphlets and books, and digital efforts such as social media or a  website. We decided to continue with social media, as we noticed a large following of social media pages regarding “memories” and history of Muskegon.</p>

			<h4>Staying Anonymous</h4>
			<p>While I had sufficient knowledge of urban planning and design concepts and my partner in the project received a degree in Architecture and Urban Planning, the majority of our work with Reimagine Muskegon was based in extensive research on each topic we would cover. With this, we never revealed our identities to the public while the project was active in order to avoid our ages or backgrounds playing any role in the perceived validity of our work.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="mkg-color">The Product</h3>
			<span class="summary">Every few days, we would identify topics of discussion based on current urban development issues in Muskegon, contextualize these issues historically and socially, and provide an outlet for public discussion on these topics.</span>

			<h4>Taking Shape</h4>
			<p class="last-p">The general structure of the project involved creating a Facebook page where we would identify topics of discussion and create posts with an accompanying graphic to visualize the context and title of the post. The post would provide in depth information about the context and history of the topic as well as how the subjects of each topic have impacted the area socially. With this information, an open question would usually be added to the end of the post to provoke discussion and community dialogue on the topic.</p>

			<h4>Scaling</h4>
			<p class="last-p">After months of only creating Facebook content, we decided to grow our presence to Twitter. With this expansion, we knew that our Twitter page would have to serve a different purpose than long informative posts. While continuing to post our main content on Facebook, we decided to mold our mission for Twitter into an educational and promotional page that focused on sharing urban design articles and ideas from other cities and discussing them in the context of Muskegon, sharing positive content about Muskegon, and promoting our latest posts on Facebook.</p>

			<h4>Impact</h4>
			<p>After about a year of producing content about urban design in Muskegon, we started to see how our effort was impacting the community. Not only was our reach and engagement growing on our social media pages (occasionally reaching thousands of people), but we were also seeing external interest and validation of our project. We had been referenced in local news articles as a source of information and we had been in contact with city officials about working on county-wide projects.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project_section">
			<h3 class="mkg-color">Reflection</h3>
			<h4>Don't Wait for External Validation of Goals</h4>
			<p class="last-p">Prior to Reimagine Muskegon, my partner on the project and I had been involved in two other projects that quickly reach their end once we tried to involve outside organizations or city officials. With this in mind, we knew that we wanted to keep Reimagine Muskegon as our own project, without looking for external assistance. We created content that we felt was important and we stayed focused on our own goals. Through this project, I learned the value of putting your effort toward a goal and following through with that effort rather than waiting for others to validate your ideas and actions.</p>

			<h4>Not All Feedback is Good Feedback. That's Okay.</h4>
			<p>While the majority of our feedback was great, we often received negative comments on our posts. We realized that this negativity was nothing more than people who held different opinions than our own about the topics we discussed. Rather that feeling bad about this negativity, we accepted it knowing that while not everybody’s thoughts aligned with ours, the fact that they participated in the discussion at all meant that we were making progress with our goal of educating and promoting community engagement.</p>
